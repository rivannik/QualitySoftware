# QualitySoftware
JavaFX project that I made that represents a demo software with a login system that shows users London Air Pollution data.
While making the project I learned a lot about JavaFX as an invernment but most importantly I learned how to:


  1: Connect to and work with a database with Java
  2: Use the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to send actual emails with Java
  3: Work with Json files and APIs . I worked with the OpenWeatherMapAPI to get accurate statistics about the weather in London.
